# Neural_Network_without_libraries

Build a Neural Network from scratch for regression problem y=x1*x2 using only basic libraries in python like numpy 
concets implemented - 
1. Activation functions
2. flexible number of layers as input 
3. priting network 
4. derivatives of activations 
5. training using max iteration 
6. optimizer
7. L2 regularization

to dos - 
1. check the NaN error for some of the outputs
